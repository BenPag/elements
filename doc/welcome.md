# inovex elements {ELEMENTS_VERSION}

> The last interoperable UI library for any framework.

This repository provides lovingly crafted components based on native Web Components as well as integration layers for the [Angular](https://github.com/angular) framework and the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) library.

## Why @inovex/elements?

As we all know, new frontends often go along with redundant tasks like developing inputs, selects or more complex elements like tooltips. Since the rise of web components has finally happened with native browser support in all major browsers, we take this opportunity to make our all lives easier and provide a set of ready-to-use UI components.

This project provides a set of small and generic components to be used in any project. The fundamental elements having a high interoperability with major frameworks like Angular, React, Vue or any good old plain website without any complex framework.

The advantages are faster development cycles and fewer maintaining resources. The native elements are designed by inovex to match our brand, increase the consistency and decrease the redundancy of our projects. We decided to make all the elements public available to all developers to allow others to use and contribute to our work.
